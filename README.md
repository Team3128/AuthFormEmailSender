# AuthFormEmailSender

**AuthFormEmailSender** is a Google Apps Script that automates the process of verifying new members in your Google Sheet.  

When a 3128 member marks a response as "verified":  
1. It sends an email notifying the respondent that they have been accepted into 3128's scouting alliance.  
2. It adds the respondentâ€™s information (name, team, email) to a master sheet.  
3. It updates your Firebase Firestore database with the new member's information. (overrides previous info)

## Features
- Automatic email sending via Gmail.
- Master sheet tracking in Google Sheets.
- Firebase integration to store member info.
- Manual scanning for testing.
- IF at any point you do NOT want to send an automated email/add a user to the master sheet/firebase, check that respective box BEFORE checking the "verified" column.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy of the sender.js & paste it into a scripts in whatever google sheet you want the auth form to be in (probably linked to an auth form). 
2. **Replace placeholder values** in `CONFIG` with your own:  
   ```javascript
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID: "YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID"
   FIREBASE_COLLECTION: "YOUR_FIREBASE_COLLECTION"
   FIREBASE_DATABASE: "(default)" // usually leave as "(default)"
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL_FILE_ID: "YOUR_FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL_FILE_ID" // Drive file ID of your service account JSON. You need to download a service account key (admin), and then place it into your drive. Share it with the email that is running the script (not the user who is checking the boxes but rather the one who owns the script).
   SUBJECT: "Your email subject here"
   MESSAGE: "Your email message here"
